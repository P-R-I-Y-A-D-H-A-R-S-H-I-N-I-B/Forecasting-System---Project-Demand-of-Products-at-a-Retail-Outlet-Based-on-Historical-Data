#                                       Project Description 
## Project Objective & Brief
    I have designed a forecasting system with the help of ARIMA models and facebook's prophet library. 
    It is used for predicting the demand for products at a retail outlet based on historical data.
## Project Guidelines
    Create a dataset , clean the dataset and sanitize it.
    Choose the correct forecasting model for the dataset.
    Fit the model to the dataset and make predictions.
    Visualize the predictions.
## Expected Project Outcome
    Learn about different forecasting models like ARMA and ARIMA.
    Get knowledge in python libraries like numpy, pandas, statsmodels, prophet and get familiar with industry type projects.
## Software Requirements
    Jupyter Notebook
    Python
    Windows O.S
